## Investment Portfolio
Investment Portfolio is a specialized tool designed to help you keep track of your investments. It allows you to organize and manage various types of assets, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, equity, and exchange-traded funds, in one place. This app simplifies the process of monitoring and managing your investment portfolio.

## How to use the App

1. Start by adding an "Investment Segment" and an "Investment Category".
2. Define default accounts to be used for the investment portfolios in the company in the Investment Portfolio Accounts section. Bank Account (From where investment amount will be deducted or credited), Capital Account (Generally demat account where stock holding is kept), Investment charges Account (To debit brokerage charges), Investment Income Account (Where capital gains will be credited).
3. Fill in the basic information, such as Segment, Category, Script (investment name), and Date of Investment in the Portfolio Investment Form.
4. In the Entry section, provide essential details like Quantity (Stock or fund quantity purchased), Entry Price (the price at which you bought it), Entry Charges (Charges like brokerage, taxes, etc. for entry), Total Cost of Ownership (Total Amount after entry charges).
5. If you like to provide charges to calculate the total cost of ownership, click the check box "Set Entry Charges Manually". Otherwise, the system will calculate charges based on "Total Cost of Ownership".
6. Default accounts for investment accounting entry will be picked up automatically from the company, but you can still change them here for specific transactions.
7. After you've entered everything, submit the information. The system will create a journal entry that credits your Bank Account and debits your Capital Account and Investment Charges.
8. If you already have an existing Investment Portfolio, check the "Is Existing" box and then link the Journal Voucher of entry in the Entry Section.
9. Once submitted, your investment portfolio entry status will change to "Holding".

### Exit Process:
1.	When you want to sell or exit an investment in the Investment Portfolio app, you will need to give exit details against the invested or partially exited investment portfolio. 
2.	In the Exit section, provide details like Exit Quantity (Sold quantity), Exit Price (the price at which you sold it), Exit Charges (Charges like brokerage, taxes, etc. for exit), Net Exit Amount (Total Amount after exit charges).
3.	If you like to provide charges to calculate the total cost of ownership, click the check box "Set Exit Charges Manually". Otherwise, the system will calculate charges based on the "Net Exit Amount".
4.	Default accounts for the exit of investment will be picked up automatically from the company, but you can still change it here for specific transactions.
5.	Once you've filled in all the exit details, you can click on "Create Exit JV" (Journal Voucher). This action triggers the system to automatically create a journal entry. In this journal entry, the app will debit the bank account and investment charges, and credit the capital account and income account.
6.	After you've submitted the journal entry, it will be added to the Investment Portfolio in the Investment Portfolio Segment table. 
7.	You can also exit your investment partially at various dates and repeat this exit process against the same investment.
8.	The status of the investment will be updated as "Exited" or "Partially Exited" based on the remaining quantity of the investment you hold.

This process helps you add and manage your investments, and it automatically records your financial transactions.
